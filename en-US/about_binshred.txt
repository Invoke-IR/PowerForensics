SHORT DESCRIPTION
	Describes the syntax and usage of the Invoke-BinShred cmdlet.
	
LONG DESCRIPTION
	The Invoke-BinShred cmdlet is a general purpse cmdlet for parsing
	binary files. To direct the parsing of this binary data, you describe
	the file format using a simple text-based template structure.
	
	Most binary file formats are structured into a series of conceptual
	regions. For example, a header, followed by a body, followed by some data
	rows, followed by a footer. These regions usually have properties. For
	example, a header might have a few "magic bytes", followed by a length
	field, followed by a version number.
	
 A simple example
	Consider a simple example of the following binary content:
	
	PS C:\> Format-Hex words.bin

			   Path: C:\words.bin

			   00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

	00000000   4C 48 02 00 00 00 05 00 00 00 48 65 6C 6C 6F 05  LH........Hello.
	00000010   00 00 00 57 6F 72 6C 64                          ...World
	
	From either documentation or investigation, we've determined that the file
	format has two main portions: a header, followed by a list of words. The
	header itself has 2 bytes in ASCII as the magic signature, followed by an
	integer representing the number count of the number of words. After that,
	each word entry has an integer representing the word length, followed by a
	word (of that length) in UTF8.
	
	A BinShred Template (.bst) for this file looks like this:
	
		header :
			magic (2 bytes as ASCII)
			wordCount (4 bytes as UINT32)
			words (wordCount items);
		words :
			wordLength (4 bytes as UINT32)
			word (wordLength bytes as UTF8);	
	
	Regions are identified as words followed by a colon. Within a region, you
	identify properties by writing their property names followed by the length
	and data type of that property. A semicolon identifies the end of a region.
	
	When you supply this template to the Invoke-BinShred cmdlet, the resulting
	object represents the data structures contained in that binary file as
	objects.
	
	PS > binshred -Path .\words.bin -TemplatePath .\wordParser.bst

	Name                           Value
	----                           -----
	magic                          LH
	wordCount                      2
	words                          (...)

	PS > (binshred -Path .\words.bin -TemplatePath .\wordParser.bst).Words[0]

	Name                           Value
	----                           -----
	wordLength                     5
	word                           Hello
	
 Supported features in a BinShred Template
 
	Whitespace / Capitalization
		BinShred templates are not sensitive to whitespace or capitalization.
		Newlinesor spaces can be added as desired.
		
	//
		A single-line comment. This type of comment does not appear in the
		parsed result objects, unlike the documentation comments described below.
		
	/* */
		A block comment. This type of comment does not appear in the
		parsed result objects, unlike the documentation comments described below.	
		
	LABEL : ... ;
		A region of a file to be parsed.

		The LABEL of the region can be any name of your choice. The colon is
		mandatory, as is the trailing semicolon. The region between the colon
		and semicolon represents properties of that region. The LABEL will be
		used as a property name on the resulting parsed object.
		
	PROPERTY (BYTES bytes as DATATYPE described by LOOKUPTABLE)
		A property definition within a file region.

		The name of the property ("PROPERTY") can be any name of your choice.
		The parenthesis (and their contents) are optional. Without parenthesis,
		the property will be treated as a nested property definition, and
		BinShred will look for a LABEL of that name to continue processing.
		
		If you include parenthesis, this will provide instructions on how
		to interpret that property.

		The byte count ("BYTES") is mandatory. It may be either an absolute
		number (10 bytes ...), or refer to a property that would have
		already been parsed - for example "( header.ByteCount bytes ... )"

		The optional "as DATATYPE" section of the parsing instruction
		describes how to interpret these bytes. If not specified, the property
		will use an array of bytes as its data type. Supported data types are:

			ASCII, UNICODE, UTF8, UINT64, UINT32, UINT16
			INT64, INT32, INT16, SINGLE, FLOAT, DOUBLE
			
		The optional "as described by LOOKUPTABLE" section of the parsing
		instruction lets you define a lookup table that maps this property
		value to a more meaningful description. This description will be
		included as a "PROPERTY.description" property.

	PROPERTY (COUNT items)
		A property that is an array of items.
		
		The parenthesis are mandatory, as is the COUNT field. The COUNT field
		may be either an absolute number (4 items), or refer to a property
		that would have already been parsed - for example
		"( header.ItemCount items )". You must also define a parsing
		rule that matches this property name to describe the data format of the
		property items.
		
	/** Comment */
		A documentation comment.
		
		If you include this above a property definition, this comment will
		be included as a "PROPERTY.description" property for that region.
		If you include this above a lookup table definition, this comment
		will be added to the "PROPERTY.description" field of the property
		being described by the lookup table.
		
	(Additional properties identified by PROPERTY from LOOKUPTABLE)
		A property inclusion rule.
		
		This is useful when you have a file structure that changes based on
		the value of a property that you've already parsed. For example, a
		'version' property might imply different properties for different
		versions. These additional properties will be included as sibling
		properties of the current region, rather than nested regions.
		
	LOOKUPTABLE : VALUE : LABEL ;
		A lookup table for property inclusion rules.
		
		This form of lookup table is used to identify the region / definition
		that should be used to parse the rest of the data in this region. The
		beginning colon and trailing semicolon are mandatory.
		
		The "VALUE : LABEL" pair can be repeated. Each new pair should be
		placed on separate lines for clarity, although it is not required.
		
		Values can be strings, integers, hexadecimal constants, or arrays of
		these three data types.
		
	LOOKUPTABLE : VALUE : "Description" ;
		A lookup table for property descriptions.
		
		This form of lookup table is used to add additional context-sensitive
		documentation to property values when a rule uses the
		"as described by LOOKUPTABLE" feature. The beginning colon and
		trailing semicolon are mandatory.
		
		The "VALUE : "Description"" pair can be repeated. Each new pair should be
		placed on separate lines for clarity, although it is not required.
	
 A complex example
 
	The following BinShred template demonstrates many of these concepts by
	parsing simple Windows bitmap files:

			fileSize (4 bytes as UINT32)

			/** Application specific */
			reserved1 (2 bytes)

			/** Application specific */
			reserved2 (2 bytes)

			importantColors (4 bytes as UINT32)
		;
