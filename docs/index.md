<h1 align="center">PowerForensics - PowerShell Digital Forensics</h1>

<h5 align="center">Developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/jaredcatkinson">@jaredcatkinson</a></h5>

## Overview
The purpose of PowerForensics is to provide an all inclusive framework for hard drive forensic analysis.
PowerForensics currently supports NTFS and FAT file systems, and work has begun on Extended File System and HFS+ support.

Detailed instructions for installing PowerForensics can be found <a href="http://www.invoke-ir.com/2016/02/installing-powerforensics.html">here</a>.

## Public API
PowerForensics is built on a C# Class Library (Assembly) that provides an public forensic API.
All of this module's cmdlets are built on this public API and tasks can easily be expanded upon to create new cmdlets.
API documentation can be found [here].
